    "Next, this is a RandomForest model that predicts the air quality category (defined by the EPA, like as \"Good,\" \"Moderate,\" or \"Unhealthy\") for the next 1 to 3 days based on the environmental and pollution-related features from our dataset. \n",

    "It begins by loading and preparing the dataset, converting date columns, extracts seasonal signals using sine and cosine transformations of the day of the year (this is necessary because the end of the year and start of the year should be continuous, weather is almost the same Dec 31st as on Jan 1st). It also computes rolling averages of AQI and pollutant concentrations and generates future AQI columns by shifting the data forward by 1, 2, and 3 days. The data is then split chronologically into training, validation, and test sets. The AQI values are mapped into the EPA-defined categories. A machine learning pipeline is created using a StandardScaler for feature normalization and a RandomForestClassifier for the classification. Separate models are trained for each 1, 2, and 3-day predictions. Finally, the models are evaluated on validation and test sets using exact accuracy (how often the prediction matches the true category exactly) and within-one accuracy (how often the prediction is off by at most one category).\n",
